These are my personal nixos system configuration files using flakes in constant development.
This is how it looks right now.

## Important Notes
- `distrobox` is best installed locally from their GitHub repo since the nixpkgs version mounts `/nix` in the containers which leads to problems.

## TODO
- notification support in `iiserpune-selenium-login`
- inspect `caa` issues, add it to bar
- make bluetooth headset default using wpctl when connected
- cursor themes
- customize waybar
- wofi theme
- colume and brightness sliders using eww
- caffeine extension (using hypridle?)
- eww bar
